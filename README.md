# online-payment-fraud-detection
📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent online payment transactions using Machine Learning techniques. With the growing adoption of digital payments, fraud detection has become crucial to ensure secure and trustworthy transactions.

🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for ML models

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains transaction records with features like transaction amount, type, and balance information. The target variable indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent or non-fraudulent.



📊 Approach

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying patterns, correlations, and imbalances.

Model Training – Applying ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.

Evaluation – Using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

📌 Future Work

Experiment with Deep Learning models (LSTMs/Neural Nets)

Handle class imbalance using SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning

Deploy the model as an API or web app for real-world usage
